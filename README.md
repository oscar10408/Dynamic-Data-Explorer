# 🌍 Interactive Life Expectancy Visualization

This project features an interactive line chart built with Plotly to explore global **life expectancy** data from 1952 to 2007. Users can hover over lines to view tooltips for different countries and gain insights into health trends across decades.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive line plot with hover tooltips
- Country-wise filtering and color coding
- Timeline from 1952 to 2007 using Gapminder data
- Built using Plotly and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Data Source

- Gapminder dataset (life expectancy, GDP, population, continent)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab
2. Run all cells to view and interact with the visualization
3. Optional: Record a screen capture to showcase interactions as a GIF
